It is a multitasking program. It does what a regular calculator does with the addition of some other features such as solving and representing equations of first and second degree and solving and drawing differential equations of first degree. In addition to that you can also use the application to creat QR codes in the form of png files for list of URLs you want.

## How to use it?

Befere running the code, you need to install some libraries and import some.

Tkinter:  for graphical user interface.
math: for the mathematical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: helping ploting the curves.
scipy.integrate: helping doing integration problems.
pyqrcode: helping creating qr codes.
random: in order to generate random numbers.
googletrans: translation.


At the moment you start the application, you will be asked to enter a path where the created qr pngs will be saved. Then the lines in the 'untranslated' file will be translated and saved in the 'translated' file.

In the section of the calculator, just use it as the normal calculator to do your calculations. 

If you want to solve differential equation, just click on Solving differential equation button and you will be asked to enter the coefficients in the terminal.

Once you entered theses coefficients the graph of the differential equation will be displayed on the screen. 

Getting to the section of creating a Qr codes in the form of png files, once you need to creat Qr pngs for specific URLs, just type the URLs in the read files and the Qr pngs will be created and saved.

At the section of Solving first or second degree equations, all you have to do is to enter the coefficients of the equation you want to solve and graph it and click solve equation button. Once you clicked it the solution will be displayed on the screen and the graphs will be displayed too.
